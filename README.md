# BluetoothScouter
A bluetooth scouting application for the HOT Robotics team, using firebase, 7 bluetooth phones in constant connection,
and a wireless LTE network to scout teams, load them into json, update the remote database.

For a browser for the firebase database, try here: https://github.com/pianist1119/BluetoothScouterPits/

Note for setup: All email/password stuff is configurable, but you must build the server with your google-services.json to use this with YOUR firebase database.
